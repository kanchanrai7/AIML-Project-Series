The College Admission Inquiry Bot, built with Python's Tkinter and ChatterBot, offers a user-friendly interface. Users input queries in an expanded entry, and the bot responds, with the conversation history displayed in a scrolled text widget. User input is in the default color, and bot responses are presented in a distinct blue hue.
